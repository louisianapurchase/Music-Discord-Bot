If you want the code to run on your own server
you must have a discord bot already created in the discord developer portal
create a file named 3510.env with your discord token
create a second file with a lyrics Genius token 
both tokens are required
lyrics Genius token file should be an txt file
file name should be api key.txt
you can manually change file names in the code as well if preferred
Code will be updated frequently make sure you are using latest version 
Discord bot should send a message as well as instructions when joining server
Enjoy
